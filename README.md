# Chocolate-Sales-Analysis
## Overview
This project analyzes a chocolate sales dataset using SQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualization. The goal is to uncover insights such as sales trends, customer preferences, and product performance.
## Why This Theme
I chose chocolate sales as the theme because it's a fun, relatable product that allows for realistic business analysis. As someone with experience working in a sweets and treats store, I wanted to connect my real-world retail knowledge with data analytics. This project helped me practice analyzing sales performance and trends â€” skills that are highly relevant for business and data analyst roles.
## Tools Used
- SQL (for querying and KPI calculation)
- Power BI (for dashboard creation and data visualization)
## Key Features
- Monthly sales trend analysis
- Best-selling chocolate types and brands
- Regional performance comparison
- Average revenue per customer
- Total Sales and Total Boxes Correlation
## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle. (Note: The exact source is unknown, but it was labeled as a chocolate sales dataset for practice purposes.)

I chose this dataset because it provides a concise yet realistic snapshot of chocolate sales over 8 months in 2022. While limited in duration, the dataset was well-structured and ideal for practicing key analytical techniques such as sales trend analysis, customer behavior insights, and performance benchmarking. Its manageable size allowed for fast iteration with SQL queries and Power BI visualizations, making it a practical choice for a portfolio project focused on demonstrating analytical thinking, business insight generation, and dashboard design.
## Key Insights / Findings
- Smooth Silky Saltly is the highest sales during the 8-month period.
- The highest sales occurred in January may be due to New Year celebrations and holiday gifting, which often drive increased demand for sweets.
- Australia outperformed other countries, possibly due to a larger market size, stronger consumer demand for chocolate, or effective local distribution and marketing strategies.
- As sales increase, the total number of boxes sold also rises roughly proportionally
